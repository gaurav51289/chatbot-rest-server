ANSWER raw: if you have installed linux only and want to remove it to install windows:

insert the dvd of windows 7 and format the full hard disk to remove ubuntu and install windows 7

if you have both os installed i recomend you to use os-uninstaller

you just need to boot from a live cd with ubuntu, install os-uninstaller and then remove the os you want to delete (in this case ubuntu)

ANSWER raw: easiest way, set the ubuntu hard drive as your first/primary drive. then in terminal run 
sudo grub-update 
that should automatically recognize the other windows partitions on the other drives and add them automatically.
you can also change the primary boot partition in: /etc/default/grub

ANSWER raw: i did it. to solve this problem you must follow these steps:

when windows lets you choose between windows and ubuntu choose ubuntu
when the computer exits from the os choosing screen restart your computer, and try to boot ubuntu while holding the shift key on your keyboard
then there will appear a screen from grub (boot loader for ubuntu) and it will be almost empty. press 'e' key on your keyboard (to load boot commands for ubuntu)
after pressing 'e' key computer will display a set of commands that grub use for booting ubuntu
in those boot commands try to find the line that contains 'ro quiet splash' and change the 'ro' word to 'rw'. it should now read rw quiet splash.
down at the bottom of the screen there is a key to press to boot (for me it was crtl+x or f10), press that key and grub will boot ubuntu with your modified boot commands.

however the 'rw' word won't be saved and at the next boot it will be 'ro' again so you 
need to edit the /etc/default/grub file were you will find same boot commands that grub uses to boot ubuntu.
type sudo gedit /etc/default/grub in terminal. you need to use sudo to be able to edit the file, which otherwise will be read-only. 
find the line that looks like this:
grub_cmdline_linux_default="quiet splash"
change it to this:
grub_cmdline_linux_default="rw quiet splash"
now save the file and go back to terminal. type sudo update-grub. ubuntu will now generate a new /boot/grub/grub.cfg file for you. it is possible to edit this file directly, but editing /etc/default/grub and then generating grub.cfg is recommended. if you reboot your computer, you should find that it boots normally again.

ANSWER raw: your boot repair log clearly shows that your ntfs partitions are intact (they're /dev/sda1, /dev/sda4, and /dev/sda5. except for the very latest version, fdisk is useless on gpt disks, and it will show just one partition (typically partition #1). your report of gparted showing just one partition is more troubling, but you haven't shown the actual program output, so it could be you've misinterpreted something. you might want to post the output of sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda and/or sudo parted /dev/sda print to verify that your partitions are present. (you'll probably need to install gdisk from a package of the same name.)
assuming that your boot repair log is accurate and up-to-date, my guess is that you've got a boot loader problem, not a partition problem. your description of the nature of this problem is unclear, though. broadly speaking, several solutions commonly work:

disable secure boot -- you mentioned disabling "safeboot" in your question, so if you meant secure boot you've probably already done this. if not, though, see this brief description for some general information. unfortunately, details vary greatly between computers.
update your firmware -- check with the manufacturer for any available firmware updates. these can fix bugs, which are rampant in the efi world. i recommend doing this before trying the next two options; or if you put it off, try refind and/or boot repair again after updating the firmware.
test (and perhaps install) refind -- my refind boot manager can often help. you can try the usb flash drive or cd-r image (available from the refind downloads page) without making any changes to your computer. if that boots both linux and windows, installing the debian package in refind should fix the problem. (a caveat, though: some hps have known efi bugs that may require jumping through some extra hoops to get refind to launch automatically. see here for details.)
use boot repair -- boot repair can often fix boot problems; however, since you've already tried it and it didn't help, i wouldn't hold out too much hope. one additional thing is worth trying, though: click the advanced option and check the box to rename and replace the windows boot loader file. this is helpful on buggy efis, such as some hps are known to have, that refuse to launch boot loaders except from the filename that windows uses for its boot loader.

ANSWER raw: sure you can, but windows is known to disregard installations of other operating systems.
you will probably need to edit the windows 7's boot configuration data (bcd) to add the entry for ubuntu. the easiest way is to use a bcd editor like easybcd: www.softpedia.com
after installing windows, install easybcd and add the entry for ubuntu.
this will make a dual-boot system but will still use the windows' boot manager. if you would like to use grub as a boot manager, you can find more info on reinstalling grub here: help.ubuntu.com

ANSWER raw: you should edit /etc/default/grub.
edit the file by opening a terminal and executing sudo nano /etc/default/grub. navigate with the arrow keys. once you have finished editing the file according the following instructions, press ctrl + o to save, and then ctrl + x to exit.
change the line grub_default=0 to 'grub_default=' or 'grub_default=.
the description of your os is found in the grub loader at start up. for example if the first option says something like ubuntu 64bit (on /dev/sda1), then you would change that line to grub_default=ubuntu 64bit (on /dev/sda1).
the index is n - 1 for the n'th option. so the first option is option 0. the second option is option 1. if windows is the third option, you can change it to grub_default=2. if windows is the second option, you can change it to grub_default=1. 
after you make the change to /etc/default/grub, run sudo update-grub. everything you do must be done as root. if you need help changing the file i can elaborate.

ANSWER raw: if both windows are in primary partitions, you can repair install to be directly bootable from grub. but not possible if an install is in a logical partition as windows only boots from primary partitions. second installs of windows normally overwrite the boot files in the existing ntfs primary partition with the boot flag. and it adds both installs to its bcd. you may just be able to copy bootmgr & /boot/bcd to second install and edit bcds in both installs. but best to have repaircd or flash drive for each install and run its repairs. you have to move boot flag first and then repair an install. you may have to specify not to find other installs. then move boot flag to other install and do same thing.
be sure to have good backups first. and repair tools.

make sure it will not go beyond the 4 primary partitions, otherwise, your pc will not boot up.
you can make extra partitions with the gparted tool, but it will not aloww more than 4 primary partitions, (more extended parititions are allowed )
after making the sufficient space for windows 8 then 
install windows 8 
now you notice that only windows 7 and 8 are listed in windows' boot loader 
now you have two options:

add ubuntu in windows' boot loader by using easybcd
reinstall grub 2 by with a live cd. to see video  click here

ANSWER raw: 
i was wondering what is currently viewed as the best version of ubuntu to run alongside windows 8.

there is no relation between "best version of ubuntu"  and "windows 8" to run alongside eachother. the 2 are separate entities and grub is the software that deals with booting any 2nd or more operating systems present on your system. 
regarding ubuntu to use...

the latest long term support for ubuntu is 12.04
the latest normal release is 13.04.

either works and both are stable. so does and is any other official derivative and so does and is any older still supported release.
i do not see any problems with any of the releases for ubuntu to cause trouble with a dual boot setup. the only issues you will face are related to uefi and windows. ubuntu is not an os that restricts you using the operating system :)

ANSWER raw: so let me make sure i am getting this right, you tried to install ubuntu but you reformatted the windows recovery partition? 
if you reformatted any part of the windows partition, that data might as well be gone. if you would like to you can make a windows 8 recovery flash drive. you can create a windows usb recovery drive 
but i have a strange feeling that deleting the windows 8 recovery partition isn't the problem, i am not very windows 8 savvy but i know people do it on purpose to recover space. may i ask why a live cd or flash drive won't work?
i would recommend booting a live version of any distro and use disk tools or gparted to figure out what you resized. i know you said that wasn't possible but it may be your best bet aside from reinstalling everything.
the command fdisk -l may give us a better idea whats going on if you can get to terminal.

ANSWER raw: this is not definitive, since i've never tested it; however....
first, the mbr is irrelevant on your system, except insofar as a protective mbr is part of the guid partition table (gpt). your boot loaders are stored as files in the efi system partition (esp), which is mounted at /boot/efi in most linux installations. ubuntu stores grub in the esp's efi/ubuntu directory (that is, /boot/efi/efi/ubuntu from ubuntu), and microsoft stores its boot loader in the efi/microsoft directory tree on the esp. this is why you get the dual boot loader treatment when you want to boot windows -- microsoft uses one location for both windows 7 and windows 8, just as ubuntu would if you were to install multiple versions of ubuntu, so that one boot loader must present a menu to enable you to boot either version of windows.
in theory you might be able to create a second esp, copy the original esp's efi/microsoft directory to it, and edit files on both esps to limit them to boot just one version of windows. unfortunately, i don't know enough about the windows boot files to give more precise instructions. in fact, i don't even know that it would really work, but it might.
if you're willing to go to the effort, you could try this to get windows to do most of the work for you by re-installing windows 7:

create a second esp on the disk. in gparted, you'll need to shrink a partition by a small amount, create a new fat32 partition in that space (be sure it's fat32, not fat16), and give it a "boot flag." i also recommend giving it a unique name, like "win7esp." (this might be useful if you end up using refind or to help identify it in file browsers.)
remove the "boot flag" from the original esp.
optionally, change the type code on the windows 8 partition. you could set the "lvm flag" on it in gparted, for instance. the goal here is to make it less likely that the windows 7 installer will detect windows 8.
erase the original windows 7 partition by creating a fresh ntfs filesystem on it. give it a unique name to make it easier to identify.
re-install windows 7. at this point, windows 7 should boot directly.
restore grub as your default boot manager. if you're unsure how to do this, you can use boot repair. alternatively, you could install another efi boot manager, such as refind or gummiboot.
in linux, launch gparted and undo the partition type code changes you made earlier -- reset the boot flag on the original esp and, if you changed the type code on the windows 8 partition, remove that flag to restore it to the correct type code.
in linux, type sudo update-grub to get it to re-detect boot loaders, with any luck including both of the windows boot loaders. if that fails, you may need to edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom to add a custom menu; or you could install my refind boot manager, which should detect both copies of the windows boot loader.

i make no promises that this procedure will work. also, even if it does work, it may create problems down the line, because windows doesn't support more than one esp per system. (the efi specification says it's ok, though.) thus, a future windows update or re-installation could end up getting confused and misbehaving. you should be able to work around such problems by temporarily resetting the type code on one or the other esp (that is, removing its "boot flag" in gparted).
if this procedure doesn't work, or if it sounds too involved for you, i recommend you ask about this on a windows forum, since windows boot loader configuration is more of a windows issue than a linux issue.
two more points:

afaik, ubuntu is still giving its linux partitions the same type code that windows uses. this makes the linux partition(s) show up as unformatted disks in the windows file browser. i recommend correcting this problem with gdisk, as described here. neglecting to do this makes it too easy to accidentally trash your linux installation from windows.
windows 8 uses a new "fast startup" feature that's incompatible with dual-booting (even with windows 7). it's imperative that you disable this feature, as described here. failure to disable this feature will almost certainly result in filesystem corruption.

ANSWER raw: what you want to do is 'create a virtual machine' within your current linux install.
if you are on ubuntu you already have a number of good choices for 'virtualisation', here is the ubuntu link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/virtualmachines 
what you will need is the following.
install one of the virtual machine software systems from the above link (virtualbox comes to mind as being a fairly easy one, but i recal that xen and qemu are available).
a copy of your 'guest' os, in your case a copy of windows.
then you will need to start your virtual machine software and tell it to create a new virtual machine. then it is just a simple matter of following the instructions for creating the machine - in effect you use your windows install disk to install a copy o windows inside your running ubuntu.
some terms you may need to get your head around.
host os : for you this is the main os on your pc (ie ubuntu, the system that comes on when you turn on your computer)
guest os : the os that you want to run inside your virtual machine (ie windows)
bridge : you can get you host and guest to communicate, share internet connections, share a hdd (you may need to set up samba on your host to 'serve' a shared disk to windows).
one annoyance.
if you are running a dual boot system, you can't turn your currently installed version into a virtual machine, which is a pain as mostly when you buy a pc you don't get a copy of the os.
other option.
if you have an 'old' windows pc sitting around you can use that and 'remotely log onto it' - it takes a bit of setting up (ie time / security etc). maybe your employer can provide you with a remote logon to a pc for your requirements ?
hope the above helps you out.
if you run into any problems during the creation of the virtual macine, check back on the ubuntu forums, here is a link to an ubuntu wiki page first vm

ANSWER raw: well that was an adventure...  but i got it working.
i had to do a whole afternoon's worth of stuff, but i think the short answer is that i had to enable efi in the bios before i could install grub to the windows (/dev/sda) drive.  you would think that having efi/uefi/secure boot or anything of that ilk turned off would allow me to freely install stuff..
prior to this fix, though, i also updated my motherboard's bios firmware.  i mention this in case other users also need to do the same.  after updating the firmware i found that (in windows) my ethernet controller needed new drivers (no network connection) so i had to run back and forth from my windows machine to my other ubuntu machine with a usb stick to download then transfer the necessary files.  besides the ethernet controller drivers i also sneaker-netted anything else that looked interesting, but the nic drivers were the big issue.
so once i had windows working right (with efi turned on in the bios) i tried reinstalling ubuntu 16.10 from scratch on the m.2 drive (/dev/sdc).  this time around it went through without a hitch.  i held my breath while it was installing grub but it made it through.  
so thanks to everyone who contributed here.  this install was more work that it should have been but still a learning experience.
now to configure the ubuntu side the way i like it....

ANSWER raw: did you burn your installation cd using windows 98?
if windows 8 computer detects your cd-rom as ubuntu installation cd then the problem is not the cd-rom media but bios settings of your windows 98 computer.
try to find a bootable cd-rom disk (maybe windows 98 rescue cd?) just to verify that your bios settings are correct to boot from cd-rom.
general issues:
1. eject cd right after burning it (wait until burning is totally finished) and put cd back just to test if windows 98 can read this cd correctly
2. did you create a bootable iso cd? this is a common mistake at least for me when i burned my first installation cd's
3. did you calculate checksum's for downloaded iso before burning it to cd? 
one option is to download iso-file again and save it different name (or rename older version before downloading) and compare that two files are equal. if they are not use newer version.
4. some older cd-rom devices don't read for example cd-rw media correctly. then you have to burn your cd using cd-r media. check that you have burned your cd using media that is readable in your old computer.

ANSWER raw: so it depends on what order you installed everything, you might be able to repair, you might have to start over. i'll share some of my thoughts and if you can provide more details on how you set things up we can narrow down a solution for you.
the generally recommended sequence of installation is to prepare your partitions, install windows, then install linux so when grub2 configures it will find the windows bootloader and add to the grub menu. on machine's that come with windows preinstalled, you can shrink your windows partition using the windows disk management utility from the adminiistrative tools section in the control panel, or you can just fire up a live linux disk/usb stick and use gparted as well. 
if you install windows second it likes to be the only os on your system so will automatically bulldoze whatever grub files you had in the mbr. so in your case i hope you upgraded to windows 8.1 first.  
as far as finding an existing windows bootloader and adding to your grub menu you could try using os-prober which will do exactly what it sounds, probe your system for installed oses and adds them to your bootloader.
it's always encouraged to read up on the documentation for your relevant problem. the arch linux wiki is fantastically thorough and kept well up-to-date, the grub section is here and another good resource is dedoimedo's grub tutorial.
if your computer is a bit older then you likely should be installing the grub2 bootloader into partition containing the windows mbr which is usually /dev/sda.
if your computer is bit newer and has an efi boot partition then you can install one of the more recent ubuntu builds like 14.04 and install your grub2 bootloader into the efi partition. this may vary by device depending on how your manufacturer set up the partition scheme. you should be able to see which partition is labeler "efi" using something like the gparted partition manager.
newer ubuntu-based distros seem to work well on efi machines. i've had good luck with stock ubuntu 12.04+, linux mint 16+ and ubuntu-gnome 12.04+.
another thing you can check is your machine's boot order in the efi/bios settings. my efi settings show both ubuntu and windows and i can adjust the priority of which will boot first. if you can see the windwos bootloader in your efi/bios menu then you might just need to use the os-prober to add windows to your grub, which would be the simplest solution. 
let us know how you fare.

if this works, use your up and down arrow keys to select different devices. you will want to look for the usb drive you named or linuxlive named (linuxlive will most likely name it 'mylinuxlive'). when you find it, select it using the 'enter' key and look for a folder named 'boot'. enter that that folder then look for a folder named 'grub'. if there is another folder, enter it and select the top most file. if that doesn't work, try the next file. if that doesn't work then navigate back up to the 'mylinuxlive' folder and enter the folders 'efi' then 'boot'. select the top most file again, and if that doesn't work try the next.
if none of these options worked for you, consider finding details about your pc (like manufacture and model), and post your specs back to askubuntu. sorry if i could be no help. :c

ANSWER raw: there is no known way until now for adding a foreign, non-windows uefi/efi loader to be chain loaded by windows boot manager (windows 7/8).
regarding visual bcd editor - it is uefi capable. you can create uefi loaders for windows 7/8.
chain loading foreign, non-windows oss is possible for mbr disk scheme. you use a so called boot sector loader chaining over partition boot sector or mbr code of foreign system. you can see here how it goes.
update: (01.jun 2014)
there is a new tool for windows 8.1/7/vista called bootnext which allows direct booting of linux(ubuntu) from windows on uefi firmware.

ANSWER raw: the answer to your problem is to disable fast boot on windows 8.
to disable it - 
all control panel items -> power options -> system settings
click on the 'change settings that are currently unavailable' link to make the shutdown options available and untick the turn on fast startup option.
the reason for this is explained below with content from this source.
fast boot explained with an image:

during fast boot the system loads the hiberfile and does not use the files on the filesystem. 
so the biggest problem, and the worst problem you can have on a computer, is data loss: if you create a shared ntfs data partition the hibernation may maintain the file structure so if you try to save a file from linux into the ntfs partition it will get lost on windows reboot as it only remembers the old file structure. see this ubuntu forums thread for more information.
in general: if a disc is mounted when using fast boot, windows puts this disc and its content in a hiberfile. any changes made to the system are gone when the hiberfile is restored. this includes mounted external discs. ubuntu will refuse to mount a disc that has a hiberfile. 
one of the bad messages you see in these topics is getting a "disc has errors" when booting windows.

run this command:

if you use powershell, run this command:

ANSWER raw: 0k here is what i did and works wonders:
-1 truecrypt swapping from hdd (didnt do it yet, i will because i need some 10gb swap space later on for some gimp image processing  
2 thx to blankreg i used some of his code:  
vm.swappiness = 10
vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50
vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs = 1500  

these 3 lines are very useful but the later ones became useless once i implemented the 3rd option, although swappiness(do not set it to 0 as when ram will get full you will need to wait to swap parts of it before running the current program, when set to 10, imagine that the os will leave 10% free ram space for unexpected applications and while running them free some other 10%)   
and cache pressure is important as programs can break if the next command to be run is not in memory(setting this value to low will cause data-ram to be ejected to swap when needed and code-ram be constantly present in ram - which is bad because when you are not using firefox for example you dont need the code-ram of it so those rams could be used by the active aplication to store data-ram)  
and writeback is useful for the /home directory read writes not overflood the pdrive with lots of small writes, instead use few big writes (not sure) so that the pdrive can be free whenever a read operation need to be performed(you do want firefox not to freze, do you? this is because programs dont need to wait for writes, they just say they want to save this there and then continue on with their business, but when a program reads something, it is waiting (99% of the time) to receive what it wants and in the case of the pdrive it will take more than a few seconds and so firefox freezes)   
to implement these commands you need to edit the /etc/sysctl.conf soo run  
gksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf  

in my case the lines were not present(default values were loaded) so i just added these lines, it is possible for you to edit the lines that have these variables (append or overwrite, who cares, just do it)  
3 boot to ram,
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1594694
here is the forum, a great boot to ram script, it creates another os (now you have 2 ubuntus) one is readonly-fast-ram(do not missunderstand readonly, you can read and write in the filesystem whatever you want ie install games and programs, but once reboot or shutdown occurs those files will be lost) other one is readwrite-slow-pdrive
to enable your /home folder to store data between restarts you need to make a partition for "/home", and another for "/"
i noticed that the "/" partition used 2x800mb soo take into consideration how many applications you are going install there
i have no idea if the readonly-fast-ram os can move to swap instead of ram (preferably the hdd swap, making it just as slow as it were installed on the hdd (instead of pdrive which is 10 slower), but as fast as it was installed on a pc from the future) or it will always eat ram  
to install the script without reading the forum run  
sudo apt-get install git
git clone git://github.com/terminator14/ram_booster.git
cd /home/username/ram_booster
sudo bash ram_booster_ubuntu_12.04.sh  

caferul as the above example is for 12.4 version
durring the installation(about 45minutes in my case) you will be asked some question like make the homefolder save data between sessions and making an automatic scheduled operation at midnight (i prefer to update manually, and reading the forum beforehand i already made my /home partition separate)
afterwards your grub will have an extra (new default) option to boot the readonly-fast-ram os, in here it is awesome! i mean i click firefox and it feels like i didnt release my finger from the button and firefox already pooped(pun intended) open
to save any updates (the simple way) that you have done to the readonly-fast-ram os run  
sudo rupdate --both  

this operation saves the data inside the ram os to the readwrite-slow-pdrive, and to the readonly-fast-ram container (they are separate, this container is loaded to ram in about 45seconds in my case at bootup)
4 preloader, cant not talk about preloader, preloader is nice because it tries to load all the libraries that can be needed (instead of being needed at that moment in time and then removed) to the ram, but since step 3 already does this it is useless to install preloader if you installed boot to ram, but in case you dont want to install boot to ram then use this code  
sudo apt-get install preload  

but if you are already here (didnt install boot to ram) think of using blankreg's code to store some temporary files to ram instead of disk (though it wont help a lot, i tried it a few days ago, and firefox froze frequently enough to piss you off when the pc was doing lots of things (i was updating the local dropbox folder + installing some aplications + sufring the net about boot to ram and it still froze every 45 seconds or so, good thing i could read the letter while it was frozen)
i dont recomend using the last line of code, as my ubuntu broke a few times(~4) when running from the pendrive in workspace switcher ie mose was moving, keyboard no efect, nothing on screen was updated clock showed same time for the past 30minutes, and i really wanted to check the crash report  
gksudo gedit /etc/fstab

ANSWER raw: after you boot into ubuntu 14.04, make sure you perform a complete system upgrade (sudo apt-get upgrade followed eventually by sudo apt-get dist-upgrade just in case you have heldback packages).
you can run previously mentioned commands and the next one in a terminal window (press ctrl+alt+t for the terminal window to pop-up). if there is no terminal emulator present on your system, you can install one using the software center and typing in as keyword terminal.
after you finish updating the system and reboot, you can run this command in the same terminal window:
  sudo update-grub

see whether grub recognizes your windows os, and if it does you're good to go, i mean you done half the job for windows to finally boot-up. next you should repair your windows installation with your windows dvd, using the repair your computer option, and after you finish with this one, you can download boot repair cd iso image and burn it on a regular cd or put it on usb key via unetbootin. i assume you're using windows 7 ?
next you should restart your computer with boot repair cd in tray and after it finishes loading you can choose the 'recommended repair' option to finally fix your dual-boot configuration and be able to boot into both windows and ubuntu.
if grub does not see your windows os after running sudo update-grub, it could be because you installed grub on the ubuntu partition, and you should do the same steps, namely repair windows mbr with your bootable windows dvd, and then use boot repair cd to fix your boot problems.
almost forgot to mention that you should download the 64bit iso image for boot repair cd if you're using a 64bit system, and the 32bit iso image if you're using a 32bit os.

ANSWER raw: if your partition table is not corrputed, use super grub disk to boot into windows and compare checksums of the iso. if nothing is wrong with your iso, edit the ques. with every specific detail of your computer and check for supported hardware on ubuntu and linux kernel website.
if the installer messed up your partition table (backups, backups, where are you), try restoring it with a tool like testdisk, there are alot of howtos on the web to help you.
if, luckily, you made backups before the installation (the whole disk backups that even backup your mbr and partition table), just restore the backups and try again (with a new iso?).
but, as you said, you have important stuff on there, use your livecd to boot into a live (not installation) environment and get your stuff out of there first (that is if your partition table is intact)
finally, before you try again, make backups? you must understand how important they are and remember to make them before messing around risky stuff and there are enough websites to teach you how to do that.
hope i helped :)

ANSWER raw: yes, looks like you've installed over windows.
if your laptop has an hdd instead of ssd than the data is still there on one of the layers of the hdd. i would recommend not to put any more data on it and preferably to use a special service to recover data.
you can try to recover data yourself but you need an external hdd(usb external hdd) on which you would recover the data and also you would have to install recovery tools or use a data recovery cd.

ANSWER raw: i have a number of suggestions, none of them guaranteed to work:

use the computer's built-in boot manager to select which os to boot. you can normally get to this tool by hitting esc, enter, or a function key (usually f8 or above) soon after powering on the computer; however, there's no standardization on this, so you may have to experiment to find it. if this is successful, you should be able to boot windows, but you'll need to use this trick every time you do so.
type sudo efibootmgr in linux to see your boot options. you can then adjust the boot order with the -o option, as in sudo efibootmgr -o 2,5,0 to give priority to boot0002, then boot0005 if that fails, and so on. this won't solve the problem per se, but it may be useful in conjunction with the preceding suggestion if you want to make windows the default boot option -- you'd set windows as the default, followed by ubuntu, rather than the other way around.
install my refind boot manager from ubuntu. refind often does a better job of launching windows than does grub, so it may work around the problem with less awkwardness than the computer's built-in boot manager. note that if secure boot is enabled, when you reboot you'll need to locate and enroll a secure boot key (either efi\refind\keys\refind.cer or efi\refind\keys\refind_local.cer) using a rather limited user interface.
use the boot repair tool. this will re-install grub and adjust its configuration. it might fix things, but i doubt if the odds of it helping are that great. there's also a small risk that it will make matters worse.

try these suggestions in whatever order you like, or ignore them altogether of course.

ANSWER raw: your grub configuration is set up for booting windows in bios mode, but this won't work because you've clearly got an efi-mode installation of windows. there are a number of possible solutions. here are a couple....
first, you could edit the file called /etc/grub.d/40_custom and add an entry like this:
menuentry "windows 7 (custom)" {
    insmod part_gpt
    insmod chain
    set root='(hd0,gpt3)'
    chainloader /efi/microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi.grb
}

then type sudo update-grub. with any luck that will create a new grub entry called "windows 7 (custom)" that should work. this isn't guaranteed, though; grub is pretty finicky and flaky about launching windows. what works on one system may not work on another. you'll also probably continue to have the non-functional entry in the grub menu.
a second option is to install refind, which is an alternative to grub. if you install it via the debian package, it should set itself up automatically and launch the next time you boot; however, the windows icon in its menu will probably launch grub, thanks to the way the boot repair tool "fixed" things. to fix this problem, you can type the following commands in ubuntu:
cd /boot/efi/efi/microsoft/boot/
cp bootmgfw.efi.grb bootmgfw.efi

thereafter, the windows entry should boot windows. you'll also have an entry with an ubuntu icon that will boot grub and one or more linux penguin icons that will launch ubuntu directly. if the penguin icons work to your satisfaction and you don't want the grub icon any more, you can remove it by deleting the /boot/efi/efi/ubuntu directory or by editing /boot/efi/efi/refind/refind.conf, uncommenting the dont_scan_dirs or dont_scan_files line, and adding entries to them to keep grub out of the menu.

ANSWER raw: if you can boot the installer in bios/csm/legacy mode, you could try a bios-mode installation. that will leave you with a mixed-mode setup, though -- with windows booting in efi mode and ubuntu in bios mode. this is likely to be awkward, since you'll need to use the firmware's built-in boot manager to select the boot mode, at least initially. there are ways to make it work:

you could install refind, edit its refind.conf file to uncomment the scanfor line, and add hdbios to that line. this will enable refind to boot a bios-mode boot loader on at least some systems. this isn't guaranteed to work, but if it does, you'll then be able to boot the computer in efi mode, which will launch refind, from which you'll be able to launch windows or a generic entry for grub. the latter will launch ubuntu in bios mode.
you could install any efi-mode boot loader for linux you like. when you boot in efi mode, this will then enable you to boot linux, and some (such as grub and refind) will enable you to boot windows, too. given your current problem, though, this might not work at all. note that refind is one possible efi-mode boot manager, so you can use it for the preceding method and then try a more direct boot using refind, too. to get it to boot ubuntu directly, you'll need to add a filesystem driver so that it can read your kernel and create a /boot/refind_linux.conf file. (this is all described in the refind documentation.)
you could convert windows to boot in bios mode. this is likely to be quite awkward, though; you'll need to convert from gpt to mbr partitions and then either re-install windows or jump through some poorly-documented hoops to switch windows to use a bios-mode boot loader.

all of this assumes a successful bios-mode linux installation. it's entirely possible that you're running into a hardware problem (hardware that lacks a linux driver), in which case your only hope for installing linux is to dig up a new driver and patch the installer with it or to wait until such a driver makes it into a future version of ubuntu (or some other distribution).

select windows in the sgd menu, and then in the submenu that appears, select "fix boot of windows".

getting ubuntu working along with windows

unfortunately, you need to have a separate ubuntu partiton. if you can "unmerge" the partition in any way, then boot a live cd and open the linux partition you have(it'll be on the left bar of the file manager, but not the root partiton, as that is the one used by the live cd.
open a terminal. enter in the terminal:
grub-install --root-directory= /dev/sda

you may get the mount point by opening disk utility(palimpsest). once you execute the command, grub will be installed, hopefully recognizing the windows partition. if you need to remove grub and use the windows loader, you will lose access to ubuntu.(unless you chainload, which is outside the scope of this answer)

consider having grub on an external drive and booting to it to load ubuntu, if nothing else works.
edit: on sgd, i believe i may not have given perfect instructions. try:super grub disc->choose language and no help->english->windows->fix boot of windows? if that fails, try the activate partition option for your system(desktop vs laptop).

note you can select disks on right hand side /dev/sdx:


edit1:
the difference in sizes are because of gb vs gib (gigabyte vs gibibyte).
gb  is 1,000,000,000 bytes or 10⁹
gib is 1,073,741,824 bytes or 2³⁰

gb : 128 × 109 bytes = 128,000,000,000 bytes
gib: 128,000,000,000 ÷ 230 = 119.20929 bytes (or 120 gib)
since gparted uses gib the size is correct. 128 gb == 120 gib or 119.24 gib as shown in ubuntu (a few bytes diff due to conversions) – and:
in some cases1 a few bytes are used by hdd as further firmware for the disk and s.m.a.r.t data: statistics modifications, bad sector map etc. (meaning smart is part of (all) hdd's but should do not affect reported size.)

ANSWER raw: first:
consider gpt instead of mbr partitions.
if you have the hardware for it (uefi bios), and new enough os's (win 10 or 8, linux os after ~2014), consider using the new gpt partition scheme. 
see whats the difference between gpt and mbr when partitioning a drive

second:
choose between grub or windows boot loader and stick with it. in your case, stick to the windows one, it will be easier. despite this, i will answer below about grub as well, in case someone does want to know more.
1) there is only one bootloader/grub/boot-partition needed, and it should be the primary/first/bootable partition; either that or you use windows proprietary boot loader; each linux does not have a /boot directory - directories work differently in linux; think of the /boot partition as a "hidden d: drive" that any linux can possibly load; note: linux nor windows will effectively use that /boot partition... when you press the power button, the computers bios will first load that partition as a boot loader; then, the grub bootloader on that partition will kick off control to one of the os's - the os wont particularly know or care who handed it control
2) dont select that 350 mb partition as a new grub boot loader. you already have a bootloader: one that windows put there. that 350 mb partition was put there by windows, and i can tell in the picture because it is ntfs file system format. you dont necessarily need /boot directories in your linux os's. 
me on the other hand, i want a bootloader that is free (as in freedom) and that i can tweak and wont look windowsy. in that case, it is more complex and out of scope from this answer. use the windows one if you just want it to work. to use grub, you may have to reinstall windows or use gpt, basically starting from a scratch disk, no os already installed.
3) if you use grub and stick to mbr partition tables (vs the new gpt), you will likely always run into trouble when upgrading windows. start again from scratch with gpt, or use the windows boot loader.
4) /dev/sda /dev/sdb etc are actually not effectively directories, so you are not installing grub to those directories. instead, you are saying to find those pieces of hardware, and install grub on them. /dev/sda /dev/sdb etc are how the linux operating system automatically keeps track of new pieces of hardware (disks in this case) that are found by the os and loaded. so it would be like windows "disk 0" or "cd-rom 0" from the picture above.

ANSWER raw: you need to enter the bios and select the deviceto boot. you can enter the bios on most computers by pressing f2 at the post screen.
the post screen is the screen displayed when you turn the computer on, it displays the manufaturer name, computer model, and in most cases the key used to enter the bios...
for my asus k55a the process for booting a cd is as follows

press f2 at post to enter the bios
navigate to the boot menu
set the cd/dvd drive as the first boot option (at least before the internal hard drive)
navigate to the menu that includes the option "save changes"
reboot

if all worked out, then the pc should automatically boot the device you put at the top of the list. if no device is found to be bootable there, it will move to the next in the list. keep in mind that to boot from the hard drive, you must change this setting once you no longer need it configured as such, or you must remove any bootable media that is placed in the list before your hard drive
you may also press f12 on most pcs to get a menu of available devices and select what to boot from. this will override the settings in the bios and boot from the selected device.
here is a youtube video demonstrating how to do so...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0hkr2snz8k
keep in mind that your pc may have a different key that must be pressed to enter the boot menu / bios... this is usually displayed at post but you can try the following keys if f2 and f12 dont work (f1, f2, f11, f12, del)
if it still doesnt work find a manual for your model of pc... the manual will tell you which key to press
if it still doesnt work, you most likley have not prepared your bootable media properly. please follow the steps provided by the ubuntu website exactly:
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows
notice
ubuntu is not windows... windows programs such as word, photoshop, and internet explorer will not work with ubuntu. alternatives are provided and some programs such as firefox are compatible, but bear in mind that you will need to re-learn nearly everything you think you know about computers before ubuntu can be an effective alternative to windows

ANSWER raw: i'm not familiar with windows 8 but the principle should be the same.
but since you already had ubuntu on this machine, it might be that the partitioning is still there, unless you installed windows 8 on the entire disc.
however, upgrading windows would have erased grub (the bootloader) from the mbr.
if this is the case, then you can recover your present ubuntu 12.04 by booting from an ubuntu live dvd, install boot-repair, and fix grub.
then you can upgrade ubuntu instead of installing from scratch.
in the case you repartitioned your disc during windows 8 upgrade then the lin you mentioned should be the way to go.

ANSWER raw: i've gotten that grub> prompt before when trying to write a live iso. it sounds like the live usb wasn't created quite right, usually the live iso's (especially ubuntu's) have pretty menus and even a timer that will automatically start it in a few seconds, getting a grub> prompt means it didn't load the menu correctly. i don't think it's related to the boot options since it did get to a grub> prompt from the usb, so at least that's good.
there's probably a way to edit some files on the usb to get the menu to show up correctly, but it's far easier to just write the iso to the usb again with a different tool that will hopefully work correctly this time.
if you can boot another ubuntu try using ubuntu's usb-creator ubuntu documentation installation/fromusbstick
or if running in windows try pendrivelinux.com's universal usb installer
or also for windows try linux live usb creator (also linked on the ubuntu installation/fromusbstick page above) 
usually that unetbootin tool is supposed to at least work, but i've found it doesn't use the regular (nice) menus that the iso creators have setup
of course, make sure the iso file doesn't have errors, check it's md5 or sha1 against what it's supposed to be.

a fresh installation should look like this:

#grub_hidden_timeout=0
grub_hidden_timeout_quiet=true

#grub_disable_recovery="true"

# uncomment to get a beep at grub start
#grub_init_tune="480 440 1"

to automatically boot windows, you have to change
grub_default=0

to the number of the entry for windows in grub. keep in mind that the menu entries start at 0, not 1.
to disable the menu, you have to enable 
#grub_hidden_timeout=0

by removing the '#'.
if you then want to boot into ubuntu (or any other os) you have to hold shift ⇧ while starting, then the grub-menu will be displayed and you can select ubuntu.

ANSWER raw: it's extremely unlikely that you'll recover a fully working windows installation. although you haven't written any files to your linux partitions, their mere existence means that you've overwritten parts of the original partitions, irretrievably replacing some data on them. if you're very very very very lucky, nothing important will have been lost; but chances are at least one or two critical boot files is now toast. if you're merely very very lucky, testdisk might recover the partition in an intact-enough state to enable you to copy your personal files off. if not, you'll need to use photorec or a similar tool to do a file-level recovery.

ANSWER raw: unfortunately, you'll get a lot of completely unhelpful information on the internet about this, since the boot process on uefi-based systems is completely different from the boot process on older bios-based hardware. completely describing the relevant differences in one post here is impossible, so for full information, i recommend you check out the wikipedia page on uefi and my web page on efi boot loaders for linux. (note that "uefi" refers to the next generation of efi; essentially efi 2.x. for the most part, the two terms are interchangeable, although "uefi" is more specific and refers to a newer version of the technology.)
to get you started, though, you should first verify that you are booting windows in efi mode. this can be done in a number of ways, such as typing "bcdedit" in an administrative command prompt window. the result should include a reference to winload.efi in the "path" line of the "windows boot loader" section. if instead this line refers to winload.exe, then the system is booted in bios mode, and you need to follow more conventional bios advice for this.
assuming you're booted in efi mode, my first advice is to forget about installing ubuntu 11.10 or earlier. these versions include bugs in the installation process that make it much harder to set up a dual-boot with any other os. ubuntu 12.04 fixes the worst of these bugs. in 12.04 booted in efi mode, the installer should detect the efi system partition (esp; a partition that holds boot loaders) created by windows and add its own boot loader to that partition.
one possible complication is that ubuntu might not boot in efi mode, even if windows is installed in that mode. you can check this detail by looking for the directory /sys/firmware/efi. (you may need to use the "try before installing" option to check for this file, then launch the installer.) if this file is present, you're definitely booted in efi mode. if not, you're probably booted in bios mode, although that's not 100% certain. if you find you're booting in bios mode, you should either correct that problem or go ahead and install in bios mode and switch your boot mode afterward. either of those options is worth a whole new question here, so i won't go into them.
ideally, if ubuntu 12.04 installs correctly, it'll detect windows and make grub 2 the default boot loader, so the system will work as expected, offering you a boot menu when you boot. sometimes, though, you'll need to add windows to the grub configuration, which you can do by creating an entry like this in /etc/grub.d/40_custom and then re-running "grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg":
menuentry "windows 7" {
        set root='(hd0,gpt1)'
        chainloader /efi/microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi
}

other times the system may continue to boot straight into windows. this can usually be corrected by deleting efi/boot/bootx64.efi from the esp, or perhaps replacing it with a copy of the grub 2 boot loader file (probably efi/ubuntu/grub_x64.efi, iirc). unfortunately, this problem is caused by bugs in specific efi implementations, so the workaround can be highly system-specific.
your symptom of a black screen with a blinking cursor suggests a serious grub misconfiguration, or perhaps a completely missing grub installation. i'm going to duck this question by saying that with any luck it will be fixed by ubuntu 12.04. if not, i recommend installing elilo or fedora's patched grub legacy to replace grub 2, since in my experience grub 2 is the least reliable of the available linux efi boot loaders. (see the efi boot loaders page i referenced in the first paragraph of this reply for details.)

there is a guide here showing how this can be achieved, your first port of call should probably be the section entitled boot repair after a windows upgrade on ubuntu 14.04 (non-raid) 
if you want to back up your files or get at them urgently you could always access them directly from the live media, either set up live media with write space and save them there, or you should be able to move them back to your windows partition before attempting to restore grub.
edit : i have pasted the relevant section below
boot repair after a windows upgrade on ubuntu 14.04 (non-raid)
boot repair may be required when updating windows (e.g. windows 8 to windows 8.1). this will be required for example if the computer has been configured such that windows/ubuntu is selected by entering the bios and changing the boot mode between "secure boot"/uefi and cms respectively. to manually repair grub (http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd / how can i repair grub? (how to get ubuntu back after installing windows?) );

insert ubuntu installation media (e.g. ubuntu 14.04 lts 64 bit dvd)
ensure the bios boot order is set to read the media first (consult your motherboard/computer manual) and restart the computer
select ubuntu live/try mode (do not install)
click on the purple ubuntu search button - enter "gparted" and click on its icon
determine the name of your linux partition (/dev/sdxy) - you should be able to identify it by recognising its format (most likely ext4) and size (number of gb)
click on purple ubuntu search button - enter "gnome-terminal" and click on its icon
sudo mount /dev/sdxy /mnt [where sdxy has previously been identified using gparted]
for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -b $i /mnt$i; done
sudo chroot /mnt
sudo grub-install /dev/sdx [note this is sdx not sdxy!]
update-grub
exit
restart pc and remove ubuntu installation media 

if you would like the code explained or you have installed ubuntu in efi mode (if you aren't sure about efi see here) see the top answer here how can i repair grub? (how to get ubuntu back after installing windows?)

http://fedoramagazine.org/how-to-make-a-live-usb-stick-using-gnome-disks/

open 'gnome disks' tool (or search for 'disks')
insert 2gb (or 4gb) usb stick into computer (any content will be lost)
select the usb stick (be sure you selected the correct device)
use the advanced tools (the 'gear' icon) to: “restore disk image”
select the ubuntu iso file ..

step 2.
use 'shift key' method to get win8.1/bios to select that usb device as an uefi recovery usb. that assumes you bios with 'secure boot' enabled.
step 3.

start ubuntu install, choose 'erase and install ubuntu' ..


note: i used this method in feb/mar to install early 'beta' 15.04 builds (on a win8.1 laptop).

ANSWER raw: this is pretty off-topic here as it's a pure windows 8 problem.  windows 8 shut down is by definition not a shutdown -h now as we know it, but a hybrid hibernate.
as we're trying to rescue the ubuntu partition, it's back on-topic again!  ;-)
basically, all your data is still there, it's just invisible, so even booting from a live cd and using gparted will not show you the partitions.
steps to take:

stop doing recovery on the disk itself now.
buy an additional hard disk
add the new hard disk to the machine
boot a liveusb, install ddrescue
go to a terminal using 
ddrescue --binary-prefixes --cluster-size=64 --timeout=20s /dev/sdx /dev/sdy /media/ubuntu/pathtousb/crashrecovery.log

where x is the original and y the new one
physically remove /dev/sdx from the machine
use testdisk on sdy 
if you make a mess of things, restore the image made in step 4 and try again from step 7
copy any rescued files to your current back-up drive (you do have have a back-up drive, don't you?)  if you do not have one, read the following q&a; (you're user type 4)

ANSWER raw: this is a very common problem among new users of ubuntu (or linux for that matter). i did it once :d
grub is a boot-loader (all oss have them, windows' boot loader just auto-boots into windows) and its files are stored in the same partition as ubuntu. when you deleted the ubuntu partition it removed those files.
simple fix? reinstall ubuntu from usb or the live cd. this will fix the grub files and your system should work again (that's how i fixed my problem.)
upgrading ubuntu should have nothing to do with the windows, so you can just run the command sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && do-release-upgrade from the terminal.  
this will check for any and all updates/upgraded programs and update/upgrade them. 
the do-release-upgrade command checks to see if there is a new version of ubuntu (eg. 12.04 to 12.10) and then will allow you to upgrade it.
as this is a very common error, there are plenty of questions similar/duplicate of yours.
here are a couple duplicates that might help you:
how can i repair grub? (how to get ubuntu back after installing windows?)
grub rescue - error: unknown filesystem
ubuntu boots to grub rescue
just search for grub-rescue or corrupted grub. you should find something of use on the site. if nothing pops up here, google it (oh the joys of the internet)! :d

ANSWER raw: the default installation of windows 10 requires a minimum of 4 partitions.

sda1 (recovery)
sda2 (boot/efi)
sda3 (msr)
sda4 (windows os, usually "c")

on the other end, linux os requires a minimum of 2 partitions.

sda1 (swap)
sda2 (/)

using a live ubuntu cd or usb you can check your disk's partition with the following command:
sudo lsblk -o name,fstype,size,mountpoint,label

if you had 2 windows 10 installed then you should have 8 partitions for windows and at least 2 more for linux. so a total of 10 partitions. also if you installed another windows 10 you might have erased some of your data from the original windows 10 (the one you want to recover). using the command mentioned earlier with a live cd of ubuntu you should be able to have a better idea of what happened to your system. also you will be able to access your windows partition from nautilus and backup any data.
with the information provided, i think at this point you'll have to reinstall completely your system. if you don't want to lose any data, boot first with a live ubuntu cd or usb and backup all the data you had on your windows partition on an external hard drive usually located at: 

"/media/[username]/windows"

reinstall windows 10 completely, (format and delete all partition) and then, after windows 10 is working, install ubuntu but on a different partition. so a normal installation of windows 10 + ubuntu should look like this:

sda1 (recovery)
sda2 (boot/efi)
sda3 (msr)
sda4 (windows)
sda5 (swap)
sda6 (ubuntu)

please feel free to ask me more questions today, i'll gladly help. i'll be a little busy today though, but i'll try to check this page as often as possible.

ANSWER cleaned: nt know following solved problem default bootloader window used give sort error bootmanagerefi found used f12 start screen go ubuntu grub menu used get jagged screen went bios menu made grub default bootloader next time started machine got normal purple grub menu without problem still clue happened seemed work
ANSWER raw: i don't know why but the following solved the problem:
my default bootloader was windows and it used to give some sort of an error (bootmanager.efi not found) and then i used to do a f12 on the start screen to go to the ubuntu grub menu where i used to get the jagged screen.
so what i did was, i went to the bios menu and made the grub the default bootloader and the next time i started up my machine, i got the normal purple grub menu without any problem.
still no clue why this happened, but it seemed to work for me.

ANSWER cleaned: wubi maybe easiest way go make ubuntu part window upside easily uninstall like window program downside slightly slower touch le stable install ubuntu drive partition outside window guessed ubuntu installer grub2 mess window bootloader however avoid easy trick place ubuntu bootloader boot partition instead modifying one window follow link rick green added question good step step description
ANSWER raw: wubi maybe the easiest way to go, but it will make your ubuntu 'part of windows'.
the upside is: you can easily uninstall it just like any windows program.
the downside: its just slightly slower and a touch less stable then if you install ubuntu on its own drive or partition, outside of windows.
but, as you guessed, the ubuntu installer (grub2) will mess up your windows bootloader.
however, to avoid that is easy: the trick is to place the ubuntu bootloader in its own boot partition, instead of it modifying the one from windows. follow the link that rick green added below your question.
a very good step by step description how to do this, is here.

ANSWER raw: you can remove grub, but it would be unwise to do that. grub boots ubuntu because it knows how to start the linux kernel, like the windows boot loader knows how to start the windows kernel. 
you can't expect windows to boot an alien system from its boot loader, just like grub doesn't actually boot the windows kernel - it just switches to the windows boot loader.
you mention space and organisation, but grub really doesn't use that much space. on a server i logged in to which uses grub to boot the operating system, i found it only used 98mb of space and typically is found hidden away in the /boot folder.

ANSWER raw: insert your usb key in your pc and check the path of the key with the command
sudo fdisk -l

supposing your usb key is identified with /dev/sdb (normally /dev/sda is your main drive) unmount the key with the command
sudo umount /dev/sdb

once unmounted you are ready to flash win iso on the key with the following command
sudo dd bs=4m if=[/path/to/your/win/image].iso of=/dev/sdb

beware: when you launch dd command, it could take several minute with no output to end. let it go on!

ANSWER raw: ordinarily, you'll use both grub2 and the windows boot loader, because grub2 cannot launch a windows kernel directly and the windows boot loader cannot launch a linux kernel directly. to boot windows from grub2, grub2 launches the windows boot loader; and to boot ubuntu (or any linux distribution) from the windows boot loader, it launches grub2.
what you're asking for, then, is how to make the windows boot loader the primary boot loader -- that is, the one whose menu you see when the computer starts up. this can be done (or so i hear), but you should ask about it on a windows forum, since that's fundamentally a windows question, not an ubuntu question. most ubuntu users run grub2 as their primary boot loader, and have little knowledge of how to configure the windows boot loader.
that said, there are alternatives to both grub2 and the windows boot loader. see this page of mine for details. technically, what you're interested in is a boot manager, not a boot loader. (a boot manager presents a menu with a list of os boot options; a boot loader loads a kernel into memory and executes it. both grub2 and the windows boot loader perform both tasks, but some programs perform just one task or the other.) you don't say why you prefer the windows boot manager to grub2, so i can only guess at what you might like; however, my suspicion is that you be interested in gummiboot (now called systemd-boot) or my own refind. if you install either of these tools, it will become your primary boot manager, and it will then hand off control to either the windows boot loader or a linux boot loader. a final twist on this is that the linux kernel can function as its own efi boot loader, so if you use a pure boot manager, you can omit grub2 entirely when booting ubuntu. this is easier with refind than with systemd-boot because the latter can only launch programs from the partition on which it resides, and linux kernels don't ordinarily reside on that partition under ubuntu. refind includes efi filesystem drivers and can launch boot loaders from any partition the efi can read, so refind can live on the efi system partition (esp) and launch a linux kernel that's stored on a separate ubuntu partition.

ANSWER raw: i'd recommend having at least 4 primary partitions for a dual-booting computer: 1st for windows os; 2nd for the ubuntu file system (plus a logical partition to serve as a swap); a 3rd as a shared data partition in ntfs to serve both operating systems -- vital for both security of data and to not have redundancies with my programs that sync massive amounts of data locally (zotero, dropbox, etc); and 4th as a /home/ folder for ubuntu.
however, you may have discovered that windows takes more than one primary partition (it gobbled up 3 in my case, and i was able to reduce it to just 2), which means you may have to set up /home/ partition as a logical partition under the ubuntu partition. when doing future re-installations of ubuntu, just make sure to not erase the logical partition for home, and remember to mount it as /home. this can be done during the 'do something else' stage of installing ubuntu when you specify under which partitions to install ubuntu and mount-points.

ANSWER raw: you're probably using a usb keyboard on an at least somewhat old machine. usually that works fine, but occasionally it doesn't.
a similar problem was encountered several months ago. this problem almost certainly is with your hardware (usb controller and/or keyboard), and/or your bios, and neither with ubuntu (the os you're trying to boot, but which is never actually running yet) nor windows (which provides the boot menu that's not working...but is unlikely to be responsible for the problem).
here are some things you can try:
(1) enable legacy mode (for usb) in your bios setup (if it has that, and it's disabled). you can try disabling it if it's enabled, though that's considerably less likely to help.
(2) install a bios update, if there is one available.
(3) if this is a usb keyboard plugged into the front (or top) of your machine, you could try plugging it into a usb port on the back of your machine. this will probably not help, but it's possible that some usb ports (the lower-numbered ones, which are usually on the back) work better for the simple i/o that is being used before an os is booted.
(4) try a different keyboard. specifically, if this is a usb keyboard (which it almost certainly is), try a ps/2 keyboard. (it seems unlikely that this is a ps/2 keyboard, but if it is, try a usb keyboard.) this is the most likely to help.
